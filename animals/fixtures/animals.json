      "description": "A colourful parrot with a sharp mind and strong character.",
      "story": "Aria was rescued after spending many years living alone in a small cage with very little stimulation or social contact. Parrots are highly intelligent birds, and prolonged isolation often leads to anxiety and behavioural issues. When Aria arrived at the sanctuary, she was nervous, vocal, and unsure how to interact with people or toys. With time, patience, and routine, she slowly began to explore her surroundings.\n\nAria now lives in a spacious indoor aviary where she can climb, stretch her wings, and engage with enrichment items. Her care involves a varied diet of fresh fruit, vegetables, and specialist pellets. Mental stimulation is essential, as boredom can quickly lead to stress. During colder months, indoor heating and lighting must be kept consistent.\n\nCaring for Aria costs approximately £45 per month, mainly covering food, enrichment, and electricity. Additional costs include veterinary check-ups and replacement toys. Donations help ensure Aria receives both physical care and emotional wellbeing. Your support gives her a safe, enriched life after years of neglect.",

      "story": "Red was found injured near a busy road, likely after being struck by a vehicle. He arrived at the sanctuary frightened, dehydrated, and in need of urgent veterinary treatment. Wildlife rescues like Red must be handled carefully, as stress can significantly impact recovery. His initial care involved medication, wound management, and strict rest with minimal human contact.\n\nAs Red began to heal, he was moved to a secure outdoor enclosure designed to resemble a natural habitat. His diet includes raw meat and supplements to support healing and maintain strength. Regular monitoring is essential to ensure his injuries do not worsen. Enclosure maintenance and security are ongoing responsibilities.\n\nRed’s care costs around £60 per month, covering food, veterinary care, and enclosure upkeep. Unexpected medical needs can increase this significantly. Donations allow us to continue providing specialist wildlife rehabilitation.

At that age, squirrels require constant warmth and frequent feeding throughout the day and night. His early care was intensive and required dedicated monitoring. Without intervention, Acorn would not have survived.\n\nAs he grew stronger, Acorn was gradually introduced to a secure enclosure with climbing structures and natural materials. His diet includes nuts, seeds, fresh vegetables, and supplements to support healthy development. Squirrels are highly active animals and require constant enrichment to prevent stress and boredom.\n\nCaring for Acorn costs approximately £30 per month.
