            Welcome to our animal rescue farm, a small sanctuary built on compassion, patience, and second chances. 
            We are a family-run rescue dedicated to caring for animals who have been abandoned, neglected, injured, 
            or simply had nowhere else to go. Every animal here has a story, and every story matters.

            <div class="text-lime-950 space-y-4">
                <p>
                    Everything started over ten years ago, when our daughter came home carrying a small bird 
                    she had found in the woods with a broken wing. We didn't plan to run a rescue back then — 
                    we simply wanted to help one animal in need. That single act of kindness led to another, 
                    and then another.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Over time, our home and land slowly transformed into a place of safety for animals others 
                    could not care for. What began with one injured bird grew into a lifelong commitment. 
                    Today, our sanctuary is home to rescued farm animals, wildlife, reptiles, birds, and small pets. 
                    Each arrival reminds us why we started and why this work continues to matter.

                <p>
                    Our animals receive daily care tailored to their individual needs. Some require specialist diets, 
                    others need heated enclosures, ongoing veterinary treatment, or a calm environment away from stress. 
                    We focus not only on physical recovery but also on emotional wellbeing, allowing animals the time 
                    and space they need to feel safe again.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because many of our residents have health conditions or past trauma, not all animals can be 
                    handled or visited closely. Their wellbeing always comes first, even when that means limiting interaction.

                <p>
                    We are open every day, but visits are by confirmation only. This helps us maintain a calm and 
                    safe environment for the animals and allows us to plan care routines properly. If you would 
                    like to visit, please contact us in advance to arrange a suitable time.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you are planning to visit as part of a large group, school, or organisation, we kindly ask 
                    that you get in touch beforehand so we can discuss availability and ensure the visit is suitable 
                    for both visitors and animals.

                <p>
                    Our sanctuary is entirely supported by donations. To donate, simply choose an animal you feel 
                    connected to. Each donation supports the specific animal you select, helping to cover food, 
                    heating, electricity, veterinary care, and ongoing maintenance.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By donating to a particular animal, you are directly supporting their individual needs and 
                    long-term care. This approach allows transparency and ensures every contribution makes a real difference.

                Every donation, visit, and message of support helps us continue this work. Your kindness allows 
                us to give animals the safety, care, and dignity they deserve. Thank you for being part of our 
                journey and for helping us give these animals a second chance.
